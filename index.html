        <h2>puppet-runit</h2>

<p>Puppet module to create user services linked to init</p>

<h2>runit</h2>

<p>This module installs Runit and sets things up for user services.  The
recommended usage is to place the configuration under a runit hash in hiera and
just include the runit module in your puppet configuration:</p>

<pre><code>include runit
</code></pre>

<p>Example hiera config:</p>

<pre><code>runit:
  package_file: runit-2.1.1-6.el6.x86_64.rpm
  users:
    'kburdis':
      group: 'admins'
    'fbloggs':
      group: 'users'
</code></pre>

<p>This installs the runit package and configured runit.  It then calls
runit::user to configure user services for the kburdis and fbloggs users.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><em>package_file</em>: the name of the RPM package file to install - see the Runit
Package section below. Required.</p>

<p><em>users</em>: a list of users to set up user services for - see the User Services
section below. Optional.</p>

<h2>runit::user</h2>

<p>Used to set up a service directory for a user - for example:</p>

<pre><code>runit::user { 'kburdis': group =&gt; 'users' }
</code></pre>

<p>will create /home/kburdis/service managed by a runsvdir process with any logs
from this process written to /home/kburdis/logs/runsvdir/current.  The user (or
other Puppet modules) can then create services under $HOME/service.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>The title is the user's username - for example 'kburdis' in the example above.</p>

<p><em>group</em>: the group the runit files under the user's home directory will be owned by.  Defaults to the same as the username.</p>

<h2>User services</h2>

<p>System services managed by root get automatically started at boot and restarted
if they fail. And, there is a consistent way to manage them: service
<code>start|stop|restart|status &lt;service name&gt;</code>.  The idea of user services is to 
provide the same for user processes.</p>

<p>Each user has a service directory under their home directory that is managed by
their own runsvdir process.  This runsvdir process is linked to init so will be
started at boot and restarted if it fails.  Similarly any user services
configured under $HOME/service will be started at boot and restarted if they
fail, if configured to do so.  All services are managed in a consistent way:
<code>sv start|stop|restart|status &lt;service_name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Each runit service has a subdirectory under $HOME/service which is the same of
the service.  Inside this directory is a script called <em>run</em> that starts the
process running in the <em>foreground</em>, with the final command starting with
<em>exec</em>.</p>

<p>Optionally a service can have a <em>finish</em> script that is executed when the
service stops running - for example because the process died or the user
requested so.  This can be useful to diagnose failures and configure the number
of restarts in a time period.</p>

<p>If a <em>down</em> file exists in the service directory then the service will not be
automatically restarted if it fails or a boot time.</p>

<p>If the process writes output to stdout or stderr this can be fed through a
managed log process called svlogd which takes care of prefixing timestamps and
rotating logs according to a policy - for example daily.</p>

<h2>Runit Package</h2>

<p>Runit is not normally packaged by distributions so you will likely need to
clone Ian Meyer's git repository and build the RPM yourself - for example:</p>

<pre><code># yum install git rpm-build rpmdevtools gcc glibc-static make
# git clone https://github.com/imeyer/runit-rpm.git
# cd runit-rpm
# ./build.sh
# cp /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/runit-2.1.1-6.el6.x86_64.rpm \
/var/lib/puppet/files/
</code></pre>

<p>This module expects that the RPM has been placed in the directory specified by
the <em>files</em> section of the Puppet file server.  For example if fileserver.conf
has:</p>

<pre><code> [files]
 path /var/lib/puppet/files
</code></pre>

<p>then place the RPM in /var/lib/puppet/files.  </p>
