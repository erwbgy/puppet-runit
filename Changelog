0.4.0:

* Properly handle a base directory that is not '/home/${user}

* Set the SVDIR environment variable in the user's $HOME/.bash_profile rather
than in /etc/profile.d.

* Allow the command to start the service to be specified.  The run script is
usually overwritten by another module, but this is useful for simple commands.

* Allow the log directory to set rather than always using ${basedir}/logs.

* Allow timestamps to be turned off in the current log (used for
stdout/stderr)

0.3.0:

* Make the basedir under which service directories are created configurable -
default is '/home'

* Make the filestore where the runit package file is located on the Puppet
master  configurable - default is 'puppet:///files/runit'

* Make the workspace directory where files are stored on the Puppet agent
hosts configurable - default is '/root/runit'
