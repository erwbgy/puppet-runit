The\r\nrecommended usage is to place the configuration under a runit hash in hiera and\r\njust include the runit module in your puppet configuration:\r\n\r\n    include runit\r\n\r\nExample hiera config:\r\n\r\n    runit:\r\n      package_file: runit-2.1.1-6.el6.x86_64.rpm\r\n      users:\r\n        'kburdis':\r\n          group: 'admins'\r\n        'fbloggs':\r\n          group: 'users'\r\n      \r\nThis installs the runit package and configured runit.  It then calls\r\nrunit::user to configure user services for the kburdis and fbloggs users.\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\n\r\n*package_file*: the name of the RPM package file to install - see the Runit\r\nPackage section below. Required.\r\n\r\n*users*: a list of users to set up user services for - see the User Services\r\nsection below. Optional.\r\n\r\n## runit::user\r\n\r\nUsed to set up a service directory for a user - for example:\r\n\r\n    runit::user { 'kburdis': group => 'users' }\r\n\r\nwill create /home/kburdis/service managed by a runsvdir process with any logs\r\nfrom this process written to /home/kburdis/logs/runsvdir/current.  The user (or\r\nother Puppet modules) can then create services under $HOME/service.\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\n\r\nThe title is the user's username - for example 'kburdis' in the example above.\r\n\r\n*group*: the group the runit files under the user's home directory will be owned by.  Defaults to the same as the username.\r\n\r\n## User services\r\n\r\nSystem services managed by root get automatically started at boot and restarted\r\nif they fail. And, there is a consistent way to manage them: service\r\n`start|stop|restart|status <service name>`.  The idea of user services is to \r\nprovide the same for user processes.\r\n\r\nEach user has a service directory under their home directory that is managed by\r\ntheir own runsvdir process.  This runsvdir process is linked to init so will be\r\nstarted at boot and restarted if it fails.  Similarly any user services\r\nconfigured under $HOME/service will be started at boot and restarted if they\r\nfail, if configured to do so.  All services are managed in a consistent way:\r\n`sv start|stop|restart|status <service_name>`.\r\n\r\nEach runit service has a subdirectory under $HOME/service which is the same of\r\nthe service.  Inside this directory is a script called *run* that starts the\r\nprocess running in the _foreground_, with the final command starting with\r\n*exec*.\r\n\r\nOptionally a service can have a *finish* script that is executed when the\r\nservice stops running - for example because the process died or the user\r\nrequested so.  This can be useful to diagnose failures and configure the number\r\nof restarts in a time period.\r\n\r\nIf a _down_ file exists in the service directory then the service will not be\r\nautomatically restarted if it fails or a boot time.\r\n\r\nIf the process writes output to stdout or stderr this can be fed through a\r\nmanaged log process called svlogd which takes care of prefixing timestamps and\r\nrotating logs according to a policy - for example daily.\r\n\r\n## Runit Package\r\n\r\nRunit is not normally packaged by distributions so you will likely need to\r\nclone Ian Meyer's git repository and build the RPM yourself - for example:\r\n\r\n    # yum install git rpm-build rpmdevtools gcc glibc-static make\r\n    # git clone https://github.com/imeyer/runit-rpm.git\r\n    # cd runit-rpm\r\n    # ./build.sh\r\n    # cp /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/runit-2.1.1-6.el6.x86_64.rpm \\\r\n    /var/lib/puppet/files/\r\n\r\nThis module expects that the RPM has been placed in the directory specified by\r\nthe _files_ section of the Puppet file server.  For example if fileserver.conf\r\nhas:\r\n\r\n     [files]\r\n     path /var/lib/puppet/files\r\n\r\nthen place the RPM in /var/lib/puppet/files.  \r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nLicense: Apache License, Version 2.0\r\n\r\nGitHub URL: https://github.com/erwbgy/puppet-runit\r\n"}
